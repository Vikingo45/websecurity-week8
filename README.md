# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)



## Blue

**Vulnerability #1:** Session Hijacking

1. An attacker can obtain the session id of a logged on user by many means (XSS or sniffing WiFi packets, for example). Here, we use Burp to get the user's PHPSESSID.

2. Then, the attacker can use cURL from the command line to forge a GET request with such session id. Here, the command ```curl --insecure --cookie "PHPSESSID=6f4i5sk14cdrjtotdvdu8lmjd5" --request GET https://35.226.155.72/blue/public/staff/index.php``` is issued.

3. The same attacker could also use its browser to request access to the user’s page. Google Chrome allows to change a page’s cookies through the console. Below, ```document.cookie="PHPSESSID=6f4i5sk14cdrjtotdvdu8lmjd5"``` is typed in the console.

**Vulnerability #2:** SQL Injection (SQLi)

The site's ```/blue/public/salesperson.php``` page is vulnerable to SQL injection via the ```id``` parameter. This vulnerability was discovered with sqlmap. The exact command typed below is ```sqlmap -u https://35.226.155.72/blue/public/salesperson.php\?id\=1 --dbs --threads=1 --random-agent --no-cast```.

## Green

**Vulnerability #1:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

1. An attacker injects script as a feedback comment in the *Contact Us* form.  
  ![xss-1.gif](./green/xss/xss-1.gif)
2. When a logged on user loads the feedback page, the script is executed.

**Vulnerability #2:** 



## Red

**Vulnerability #1:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

1. Before the attack this is the user data stored by the site.  
  ![csrf-1](./red/csrf/csrf-1.gif)
2. A logged on user loads a [malicious page](./red/csrf/index.html) carefully crafted by an attacker. After the attack, the name and last name of first user is modified.
